	<description>Adds the Rejuvenate surgery, a way to reduce your colonists biological age.
On success the procedure will make the patient 10% younger.
For players who want to take their time and create the perfect colony. 
Also eases matchmaking since if age difference > 10 years colonists are much less likely to become lovers.
This advanced procedure can only be performed by a Skilled Professional (10) and requires two glitterworld Medicines.
The colonist Medical Care setting must allow use of glitterworld medicines.
Only works on human colonists, not animals.
A very small chance of failure exists, with the effect of ageing twice as much instead.
